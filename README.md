# VBA_Challenge
Visual Basic Scripting

The file ticker_price (previously stock_ticker) is a vba script that locates and retrieves every stock ticker from the dataframe, extracts the openning price of the stock at the beginning of the year and the closing price at the end of the year.

It then creates a new dataframe with the stock ticker, then computes the yearly change for the specific stock .

It computes the percent change for each stock for the year.

Computes the total yearly traded volume for each of the stocks.

Formats the yearly change in the open and close price to red if it is a decrease, green if it an increase and yellow if there is no change.

I updated my work to with the part I was not able to get help with in time for submission. I uploaded the updates though I'm still figuring out how to track and commit changes in git.
